<H2>Blogging is a communication channel</H2>

If you are not a geek like me, you may not know that
<ol>
<li>robots are already around us, and are here to stay</li>
<li>robots are cannot really take decisions by themselves</li>
<li>our societies will need robots to solve issues that we cause ourselves</li>
</ol>

For a more soft introduction to the topic, I wrote some blogs for the Perseo project.
These links will redirect you there!
