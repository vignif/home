<h3>Is it an 'it'?</h3>
In this post I will try to explain how robots can help mankind. I will also try to answer some of the most common questions about robots.

Robots are machines that can perform tasks that are usually performed by humans. In the past, robots were used only in factories, but now they are also used in our homes.

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello world!")
```
