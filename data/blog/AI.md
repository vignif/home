<h3>Can it think?</h3>
The wow effect of chatgpt has blown the mind of lots of scientist and general public.
It allows to literally talk to our computers. Well, not really our computers, at the end is just a program hosted in complex servers but with an extremely simple interface. The success of this tool is surely the ease access to it. We all can try to play a bit with it and attempt to challenge its logics.

The idea of having a tete-a-tete with a fancy computer sounds a lot like a fancy turing test to the point that some people around the world were assuming that chatGPT was not really automatic. eheh. that must be a good feedback for the designers.

Regular people are not expected to know how an engine works in order to use a car. Most users are simply use-ers. With AI it is a little bit more complex. If we are simply use-ers we are not seeing the reality of it. The AI is often the user. not us. 

The old programming knowledge of duck typing recalls more or less, ''if it quack like a duck and walks like a duck, is probably a duck''.
With chatGPT, however, we can fall into the romantic desire of achiving a machine that thinks, that reasons and that can have opinions. 
Luckily, we are not there yet.
