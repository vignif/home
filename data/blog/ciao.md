<H2>This is my first post on gatsby</H2>

For long time, I have been using frameworks like Wordpress in order to set up my own website.
Recently I learned about gatsby and I decided to give it a try.

I designed this website starting from @r-ichard/gatsby-starter-bootstrap-5 and I customized it as I wanted.
The flexibility of gatsby is amazing, I can easily add new pages and posts and I can also customize the theme as I want.

Feel free to steal this website and use it as a starting point for your own website with the agreement that you will give me a shoutout!

<H3>What is gatsby?</H3>
Gabby is a static site generator. It is a tool that allows you to create a website without the need of a database.
It is a great tool for personal websites and blogs.
