I was a visiting researcher at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://noosware.com/">Noosware NV</a> in Eindhoven, The Netherlands for 2 months working on the development of emotional aware mobile robotics. This stay lead to the work [Are Emotions Important? A Study on Social Distances for Path Planning based on Emotions](/publications/roomba-emotion/).
