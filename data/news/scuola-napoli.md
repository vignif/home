The highschool <a href="https://www.salesianivomero.it/" target="_blank">Istituto Salesiano Sacro Cuore </a> in Napoli, Italia invited me to give a <a href="https://www.salesianivomero.it/datemi-un-bit-e-sollevero-il-mondo/" target="_blank">talk</a> titled: "Datemi un bit e sollever√≤ il mondo" focused on the implication of Robotics and AI in the future of our societies. Around 200 students attended the talk and actively participated in the discussion. The event took place in the Teatro Auditorium Salesiano Salvo D'Acquisto.
