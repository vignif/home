This article describes building and deploying a stereo depth perception pipeline using ROS2, OpenCV, and containerized services.

- Implemented rectification, disparity, and post-filtering for robust depth maps.
- Integrated with `Nav2` for obstacle awareness.
- Dockerized services and added CI/CD for reliable deployments.

Results showed stable performance across lighting conditions and varied textures, enabling safer navigation.
