Well, not really our computers, at the end is just a program hosted in complex servers but with an extremely simple interface. The success of this tool is surely the ease access to it. We all can try to play a bit with it and attempt to challenge its logics.\n<p>The idea of having a tete-a-tete with a fancy computer sounds a lot like a fancy turing test to the point that some people around the world were assuming that chatGPT was not really automatic. eheh. that must be a good feedback for the designers.</p>\n<p>Regular people are not expected to know how an engine works in order to use a car. Most users are simply use-ers. With AI it is a little bit more complex. If we are simply use-ers we are not seeing the reality of it. The AI is often the user. not us.</p>\n<p>The old programming knowledge of duck typing recalls more or less, ''if it quack like a duck and walks like a duck, is probably a duck''.\nWith chatGPT, however, we can fall into the romantic desire of achiving a machine that thinks, that reasons and that can have opinions.\nLuckily, we are not there yet.</p>"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/AI/","next":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"fields":{"slug":"/ciao/"}}},"previous":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"fields":{"slug":"/writing/"}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3248652660","3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
